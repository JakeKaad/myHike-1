Steve's story A:

Steve finds a new hike that he is interested in, and notices that isn't on
myHike yet.  He uses his guidebook and creates a profile for the hike on
myHike, pinning it to the map.  Using that pin, he navigates to the hike.

While hiking on the trail, he takes note of the difficulty.  He also stops
frequently and takes pictures of interesting scenery.  At the end, there is a
waterfall that he takes a video of.

When he gets home, he creates a rating, describing his experience.  He also
uploads his photos and videos.


Steve's story B:

Steve wants to go on a hike he hasn't gone on before.  He browses myHike,
looking at hikes that he hasn't rated yet.   He finds a new hike and decides
to check it out.  He uses the pin to navigate to the hike.  He downloads the
route to his phone, so he can access it without a signal.

After the hike, he creates a rating that tags it as a hike he has gone on before.
