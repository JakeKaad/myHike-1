Name: Mike
Occupation: Coder
Description: Mike loves all mountain hikes, ranging
from easy to difficult - day hikes and overnight backpacking trips. He likes to
find detailed route guides that can be viewed while offline, with accompanying
detailed route maps that can be superimposed over google maps or otherwise
followed along with while offline. (He wants to be able to see his current location on the trail.)
He also wants to be able to track his own notes on the hike.


Mike story A:

Mike wants to go on a hike that is less crowded, preferring to enjoy the
solitude of nature with friends, not strangers.  He finds a hike that
other users have noted as being populated with hikers.  The hike is far from
cell phone towers, so he downloads the myHike map and route to his phone.

On the hike, he makes note of different points of interest that associate
with the map via gps.
