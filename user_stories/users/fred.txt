Name: Fred
Occupation: Software Developer
Description:  Fred enjoys scenic hikes that aren't exceedingly difficult.  He
doesn't like to travel too far for a hike.  He has a dog that enjoys hiking off
leash.  He also has a daughter that is heavy to carry for long amounts of time,
but he wants to bring her along so she can learn to enjoy nature.


Fred's Story A:

Fred sees the the conditions are nice for hiking this weekend.  He pulls up
myHike on his computer at work to browse for hikes while on break.  He wants
to find a hike where is dog can be safe off leash.  It also shouldn't be too
difficult, because he will be carrying his 2 year old daughter most of the way.

He can easily tell which hikes are easier by their average difficulty.  He
chooses a hike with a difficulty rating of 2 and a dog friendliness rating
of 4.5.


Fred's Story B:

Fred goes on the hike he discovered at work but a park ranger asks him to keep
his dog in the vehicle because dogs are scaring an endangered species of chipmunk.
He logs onto myHike and adds a rating that the hike, giving a dog friendliness
rating of 0, and noting that dogs are no longer allowed on this hike.

He then pulls up his myHike app, and finds a hike nearby that has a dog
friendliness rating of 3 and a difficulty of 2, and goes on that hike.  His dog
is off leash the entire time, and the hike was easy.  He creates a rating that
gives that hike a dog friendliness rating of 5 and a difficulty of 2.
