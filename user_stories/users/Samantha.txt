Name: Samantha
Occupation: Teacher
Description:  Samantha loves diffcult hikes with a very rewarding view at the
top.  She usually does these solo or with one other person, because she likes
to move fast.  She sometimes goes on hikes with her slower husband, dog and
daughter, and prefers these to be close to her house.


Samantha's story A:

Samantha wants to go on a difficult hike with some friends that is very
scenic.  on myHike, she sorts hikes nearby by difficulty.  She then starts
browsing, watching user videos and looking at pictures.  She finds a hike
that ends with a mountain top view that goes by 3 waterfalls on the way up.
She is particularly interested in seeing the second waterfall that somebody
got a picture of.


Samantha's Story B:

It is wildflower season, and Samantha wants to find a hike that has a good
variety of wildflowers.  She starts looking through hikes using the 'best season'
part of the app to see if any have wildflowers blooming currently.

She finds a hike where a user noted that on this day last year, they were able
to see many different varieties of wildflowers.  She looks at a few of the
pictures they took, and decides to go on this hike.
